# Bianca Power - Portfolio

This is my portfolio site, which can be viewed [here](http://biancapower.herokuapp.com/).

This website was created in partial completion of the Term 1 assessment requirements for [Coder Academy's Fast Track bootcamp](https://coderacademy.edu.au/fast-track). Please find assessment criteria addressed below:

### 1. Demonstrate your understanding of your site's audience

In considering the site's audience, user stories were created. These can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/TnYalUMt).

### 2. Demonstrate the design decisions made

As is reflected in the [style guide](https://trello.com/b/TnYalUMt), a font family and colour palette were chosen, a moodboard created, and wireframes constructed.

The **moodboard** consists primarily of images representative of the flat, modern style that I was after for this website. As someone starting out as a web developer in 2017 the modern feel is what I feel is appropriate for my professional website.

The **font** Roboto, developed and used by Google, is one that most people browsing the web are very familiar with. I wanted to go with familiarity to help users feel comfortable while browsing my site.

The **colour palette** chosen consists of three bold colours along with black and white. I chose bold colours to reflect the style and personality I want to portray as an individual, and to stand out from other portfolio sites that use more conservative colour schemes.

The **wireframes** represent the clean and easy-to-navigate feel of the website, allowing for easy user flow and getting the point across succinctly. MVP user stories are clearly addressed in this wireframe.

### 3. Demonstrate that you considered usability heuristics

With consideration to [Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics as applied to web design](http://instone.org/heuristics):

**1. Visibility of system status**

  The website is clearly branded with easy-to-locate navigation which allows users to always know where they are and where they can go next.

**2. Match between system and the real world**

  Information is presented in a clear and logical order, using language familiar to the intended audience.

**3. User control and freedom**

  A "Home" option in the menu which is accessible from every page ensures that users have an easy way to get back to the main page of the website should they accidentally end up in some unwanted state.

**4. Consistency and standards**

  The website is HTML and CSS standards compliant, and consistent throughout in terms of wording and navigation options.

**5. Error prevention**

  The contact form is designed to handle errors gracefully, minimising confusion and inconvenience for the user.

**6. Recognition rather than recall**

  Navigation is easily visible and available at the top of the screen at all times, requiring no recall from the user. Links are descriptive, clearly representative of what they refer to.

**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use**

  All pages and sections of the website can easily be linked to, allowing easy bookmarking functionality.

**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design**

  Information presented is written specifically for the web, and does not contain any extraneous detail.

**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**

  Error messages (resulting from incorrect or missing input in the contact form) are written in plain text, precisely indicating the problem, and clearly indicating the steps the user can take to a solution.

**10. Help and documentation**

  As a very basic website with minimal functionality, help and documentation is not needed.

### 4. Any wireframes

Wireframes were created using Figma, and can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/PZa0Q7zOW1tRFTyDmcjMPrtq/Personal-Portfolio).

### 5. Style guide

The style guide for this website can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/TnYalUMt).

### 6. Personal Logo

The [logo](http://biancapower.herokuapp.com/assets/logo-transparent-d0a17c3807e80680252d0511265530005c06e83c3d5446b2971f8db2b8dcec18.png) used for this site is a simple text-based representation of my initials. The favicon is the logo with a black background.
